On Monday, Jan. 8, Wellington North council approved an application for funding from Mount Forest Minor Ball for a new batting cage at Kinsmen Park in Mount Forest.

This is the second project to receive funding through the Community Initiated Project program.

Mount Forest Minor Ball said in their application that the current batting cage is "unsafe for use, being used for a town storage unit, and not in the proper location as to where the children play baseball in town."

The total cost of the project is $5,000, with half being covered by donations from two local families, and the other half being covered through the Community Initiated Project program.
“This is a great program that council approved last year," said economic development officer Dale Small. “This is the second application through the program and I think it’s a good one in terms of establishing partnerships with other organizations community service organizations, sports organizations to do things in our community that may not otherwise get done. In this case relocating the batting cage is a good thing to do at the time Kinsmen Park upgrades.”

The project will be completed in spring 2018 when the Kinsmen Park baseball diamonds are upgraded.
“This is how we move our community forward, I think, working with community groups," said Mayor Andy Lennox. “We’re more of a facilitator than a doer a lot of the time and this is one way we can help facilitate these groups to help build the community.”
