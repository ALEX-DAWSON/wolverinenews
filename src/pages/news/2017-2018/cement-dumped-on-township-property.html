Having wet cement dumped on vacant township property was a mistake, says Wellington North officials after receiving numerous complaints from the public.

The cement residue from a nearby development, was poured onto township property near the Arthur wastewater facility on Preston Street South.

A resident spotted the truck dumping the cement, took photos and posted them on  “Arthur: What’s Happening” Facebook page.

CAO Mike Givens said that is normal construction practice, but the driver made a mistake.

“In this instance it looks like the gentleman made a mistake, assumed that the adjoining property was part of the development and cleaned out the residue on the property, which turns out is owned by the township,” said Givens.

He told the Advertiser the township informed the developer of the error, but is not taking any other action.
“We trust that they will address the situation,” he said.
“We’re not going to press them to do it in a huge rush or anything.
“It has no impact ... there’s no environmental impact, it’s a vacant piece of land.”

Some may say that but others will argue that there is an effect and that it's not just a piece of land, but that the animals and vegetation need that spot to help live they probably poured the cement into a rabbit's hole or on other small animals not only the animals but the trees flowers and insects that could end up dieing due to this.

Because the cement was poured on top of the soil that makes it harder for air to get to the roots and boom there goes like 5 to 10 trees which to humans we look at it as we can use them for materials, build furniture but to animals that's food a home and where lots of families live.

It might be a mistake but it shouldn't just be left to take up space it should be cleaned up as soon as possible so it has a minimal effect on the surrounding area township property or not.
