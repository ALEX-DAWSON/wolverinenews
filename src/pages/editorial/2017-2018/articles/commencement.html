        On Friday, November 3rd, Wellington Heights Secondary School held its 13th annual commencement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The graduating class totaled 152 students (some of which were unfortunately unable to attend commencement), which is comparatively larger than the graduating classes of recent years. Over the course of the night, more than sixty awards were presented to Wellington Heights students, both graduating and still attending the school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music during the event was performed by the schoolâ€™s concert band, directed by Mrs. Stewart, and refreshments were prepared and provided by Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Rowden.
