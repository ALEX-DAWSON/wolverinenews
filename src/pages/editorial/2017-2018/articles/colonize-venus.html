title: Colonizing Venus - Cities in the Sky
description: When you think of what planet humans should go to first, many think of Mars as our first planetary home away from home. But, perhaps Venus may actually be a better option.

Currently, the general public seems very interested in terraforming and sending people to live on the Red Planet. With very little atmosphere and a fairly close proximity to our own home rock, I can’t exactly blame them for wanting to terraform Mars. But, we seem to be overlooking a perhaps less challenging planet - one even closer to our damp little rock, and even nicknamed Earth’s “sister planet.” Though we’d have to take a pretty imaginative approach, Venus seems much readier to be colonized - but not on the surface; rather, in its skies.

Landing people on the surface of Venus is, to be blatant, a *terrible* idea. If a spacecraft carrying human passengers somehow managed to touch down on the surface of Venus somewhere without dying (spoiler: that’s basically impossible), as soon as they step out of their lander they burst into flames, then they implode, and then their lander implodes. The surface is so hot (450°C at the equator) that it can easily melt lead. The pressure on Venus’s surface is 90x the pressure we experience on Earth. These combined factors have caused various probes over the years to reach an untimely end. Even the most successful missions were tantalizingly short-lived - around an hour, at most.

So, if we can’t land on Venus’s hellscape surface, then how is it more ready for colonization than Mars? Surely a planet with barely any atmosphere and lower pressure than Earth would be easier to colonize that a planet with a surface like that, right?

Well, Venus’s *surface* certainly isn’t suitable for colonization - but its skies are. Venus’s immensely thick atmosphere makes blimp-like air habitats a much more feasible possibility. This desne atmosphere is made mostly of carbon dioxide, which has a fairly heavy molecular weight of 44. This means any gas with a smaller molecular weight can float in Venusian skies like helium on Earth - and regular Earth air is light enough to float on Venus. Molecular oxygen has a weight of 32, and molecular nitrogen at 28, meaning that a breath of typical Earth air would float in Venus skies and be about 60% as effective in the skies of Venus as helium is on Earth. Hydrogen and helium is still even better to keep ships afloat, though - their molecular weight is very small, at 4 for helium and 2 for molecular nitrogen.

The atmosphere of Venus is far safer than its surface - 50-55 kilometres above the surface of Venus, its atmosphere is down to normal Earth pressure, and the temperature is down to about 75°C. A balloon full of regular Earth air would float at a level that is safe from the searing heat of the surface, but is also protected from harmful radiation by the upper atmosphere of Venus, which has roughly the same shielding potential as Earth’s own atmosphere. The airships wouldn’t exactly be drifting along, though - wind speeds at that level in Venus’s atmosphere can get up to 340 kilometres an hour. There’s still no harm in letting the balloon be carried around the planet, though.  Allowing the blimp to move freely rather than trying to keep it in one place would greatly reduce structural stress from the wind.

As early as 1971, scientists were proposing ideas of methods we could potentially use to colonize the skies of Venus. More recently, we have proposals like HAVOC. HAVOC, or High Altitude Venus Operational Concept, is still entirely hypothetical, and may stay that way for quite some time. [This short video](https://youtu.be/0az7DEwG68A) of the HAVOC concept explains what HAVOC would look like.

If we were to send settlers to this unforgiving planet, what would they wear when doing missions or repairs external to the aircraft? It certainly wouldn’t look like the typical puffy white space-suit, since on Venus one wouldn’t need a pressurized suit. All they would need is an oxygen source and protection from the occasional acidic rain showers, as well as insulation against the higher temperatures of Venus’s atmosphere. However, as advances would be made to the colonies, even those small protective measures could be done away with. Eventually, we could see domes full of breathable air - rendering oxygen tanks unnecessary, while also providing shelter from the acid rain and allowing some protection from the sweltering heat.

The goal of Venus colonization is to eventually have massive cities within these domes, comfortably supporting society and even plant life. Since the atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, it would be fairly easy to grow plants like trees, vegetables, and crops - after filtering out the sulfuric acid.The ability to grow food in these domes would go a long way towards helping make those societies almost entirely self-sufficient.

However, that concept would still be quite a bit down the road from the first launch of a scientific habitat on Venus. There are a lot of challenges to overcome before a Venus colony would be that advanced - the main challenge being the severe lack of water.

Venus is almost entirely devoid of water in any form. The clouds in Venus’s atmosphere are made out of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, plus some sulfur dioxide vapor. Speaking of the sulfuric acid, it is absolutely essential that any craft in the Venusian atmosphere with human crew onboard be constructed of or coated with corrosion-resistant material to resist the potent acid in Venus’s clouds. There is some water content in the acid itself, but it would have to be very heavily treated and filtered in order to be made safe for human consumption. Importing water from Earth or nearby asteroids would be both expensive and time-consuming, but it seems like it would be necessary based on our current understanding of Venus.

If we were to overcome that challenge, maybe by inventing a highly efficient way of filtering or somehow producing water on Venus, then maybe we could someday hope to see sprawling, thriving cities in the Venusian clouds.

However, we might be waiting for a while. The general public as it stands is far more focused on terrifying Mars, rather than looking to the prospects of Venus. As we spoke about in [this article](land-on-mars.html), getting unmanned spacecraft to land on Mars is already quite challenging. And terraforming the planet seems like quite a ways of scientific progress off, even with recent breakthroughs for this concept, like [the first worm eggs hatched in mock-Martian soil](worms-hatched-in-mars-soil.html). Though both concepts have their unique challenges, drawbacks, and positives, I personally think that we should stop looking towards the Red Planet as a potential second home, and look instead to the skies of Earth’s “sister planet,” Venus. Getting a spacecraft into the atmosphere of Venus looks to be at least slightly easier than getting a lander onto Mars’s surface, the aircraft could have a high content of breathable Earth air that would actually *help* it stay afloat, and the pressure 50 kilometres up from Venus’s surface would be very similar to the pressure on Earth. Just because we live on the ground on Earth doesn't mean we have to have every off-Earth colony be on solid ground as well. I think we should look away from the Red Planet for right now, and start looking towards Venus’s cloud-tops as our potential first planetary home away from home.
