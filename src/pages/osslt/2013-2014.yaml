                    Many cities struggle with public transportation needs.
                    New subway construction is expensive, and space for
                    above-ground rail lines is limited. Adding more buses
                    can’t always reduce street congestion. Transit users
                    dislike fare increases, but that is one way to raise
                    money for improvements. _________________________________.
